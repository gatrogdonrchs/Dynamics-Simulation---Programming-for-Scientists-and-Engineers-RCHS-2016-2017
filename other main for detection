NB. This verb should be used to operate on widgetlist, it finds all the pairs of
NB.  widgets and calls the next verb, colldet, to operate on each pair.
filter =: verb define
wlist =: i. $ y
NB. inputs a list, outputs the index of all the pairs,
NB.  not including duplicates (ex. forwards but not 
NB.  backwards).

NB. must extract the position and velocity and radius
NB.  of the widgets that have indexes y. then use those to
NB.  find the time until the collision.

NB. Calls the correct cd verb based on the widget types

NB. If both objects are stationary, don't bother operating on them.

NB. the vector that goes from the center of pseudomass
